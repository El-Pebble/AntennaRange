What are the files in this directory?

  The AntennaRange software project requires at least one web server.
  At the time this was being developed the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system
  had a BUG in the deb (APT system) "apache2" package.  The httpd, web
  server program installed as /usr/sbin/apache2 as installed with 'apt
  install apache2' would not run, with a linker/loader error:

     /usr/sbin/apache2: symbol lookup error: /usr/sbin/apache2: undefined symbol: apr_os_uuid_get

   One of these two libraries: /usr/local/lib/libapr-1.so.0 /usr/local/lib/libaprutil-1.so.0
   should have apr_os_uuid_get in it, and neither do.  So there no way /usr/sbin/apache2
   is going to load and run.

   We decided to build and install the apache2 httpd program from sources.
   It builds and installs relatively quickly and does not have a great
   number of dependences, that would tend to make this server brake over
   long time (like libBOOST etc).



FILES

  The following bash scripts download, build, and install the package that
  the name of the script suggests.  You need to read, edit (prefix and
  stuff), and understand these scripts if you need to run them.  The
  openssl and nghttp2 were needed because we the apache_http script
  installed a very new version of the apache2 web server.


     openssl

     nghttp2

     apache_http


 
  apache2/

    This directory contains the starting apache2 root directory with
    apache configuration files.
